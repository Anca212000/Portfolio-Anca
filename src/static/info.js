<p>The images from the background run automatically, they are changing every 6 seconds (are 7 unrolled images).</p>\
<p>For adding and viewing the new plans, it can be accessed these two buttons: Adauga un nou plan and Vezi un plan anterior.

<p>When the app starts, it will appear on the page a form with 2 input fields, one from which we want to begin travel (implicitly, the routes are starting from Suceava to other 22 cities in this country, Romania) and the other one is for the destination city.

<p>On the same page, a bit lower from input fields are appearing the informations about:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>(1) number of kilometers between Suceava and inserted city,</li>\
<li>(2) the hours and minutes to destination,</li>\
<li>(3) for some cities will appear the optimal way, a directly route with a minimum of kilometers and the name of the cities where the driver can pass,</li>\
<li>(4) still here, it will appear the name of the cities that national streets are passing through them, so the driver will know which cities has national streets,</li>\

<p>SAVE &ndash; save the processed image at that time;</p>\

<li>\
<p>SAVE AS &ndash; can save the photo on computer in any image type (jpg, png, bmp, tiff);</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>FILTER &ndash; here are some filters for image (negative, sepia, black white, emboss, gaussian blur, median blur);</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>ADJUST &ndash; change the colours of the image manipulating the RGB schema of the image (changing the redness of image or green shade or even the blue colour &ndash; the intensity of these are between 0 and 255); also, here can be adjusted the constrast, brightness and sharpness of the image;</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>IMAGE OVERLAY &ndash; this option opens from computer a new image (the opacity of this new image can be set between 0 and 1) that overlaps initial image and finally, obtain a merged image;</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>COLLAGE &ndash; create a collage structured of 2 images having the positions horizontally or vertically;</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>ADD TEXT &ndash; able to enter text , select the font (font-family, font-size), colour of the text using the RGB format and set the position of text on Ox axis and Oy axis (the center, O, of this axis being in the upper-left corner of the image);</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>ADD FRAME &ndash; add a frame/border around the photo and also can be set the RGB colour of the frame and more than this, can be set the thickness of the border;</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>DISCARD &ndash; erase all the modifications added over the image left it in initial state;</p>\
</li>\
<li>\
<p>EXIT &ndash; close the app.</p>\

<p>Briefly explained, this is a web chat application where the users can be connected in the same time from different browsers by choosing the meeting room and finally there, they can text each other. Firstly, the user should choose what chatroom he/she wants to send messages and also, receive these from other online persons, by typing the name of the room and of course, his/her name. This thing can be easily done when the app is accessed and the first page is the login one.</p>\
<p>In the above image is an example of two users that want to connect to the same chatroom. Then, after the both fields are completed, the newest users can send messages to each other. Also, the third person and the fourth person and much more than four persons can join the same meeting.</p>\
<p>Furthermore, the users can text with emoji symbols 😉.</p>\

<p>The app can be used both the teacher and students during some faculty's courses or labs (or during some class hours in a college, high school program), firstly creating an account (with their email addresses provided by school) and then access the web platform.</p>\
<p>In the dashboard (where only the teacher has access) can be uploaded questions with answers for the courses (via an excel file with different questions and correct answers structured on chapters) and at the same time, can be generated an alphanumeric key (that expires in 1 hour) for accessing the quiz for that course by the present students.</p>\
<p>After the questions had been uploaded by teacher, he/she can select which questions from that course (that takes place in that moment) can take part to the student's quiz ( 1 or more questions with 4 random answers - correct or false).</p>\
<p>Students (after they had been inserted the key given by their teacher) should solve the quiz - that questions selected by teacher - and finally, they can view the obtained score.</p>\
<p>Overmore, in dashboard the teacher can view the presence of every student for each course, some extra informations about the courses he/she is teaching (the time when the courses take place, their location) and a report that contains a total score for each selected question gained by the all students.</p>\
<p>This app has implemented the Speech Recognition option that allows students with disabilities or childs to solve the quizes in vocal mode - they can hear the question with answers and then can say out load the correct answer (or answers, if there are more). This option can be used by that special student (a blind one or a paralyzed one), only if had been activated by his/her teacher.</p>",

    longDescription:
      "<p>The project is titled <em>Health Inspection App</em> and is a platform/web application to manage both a doctor's patients, as well as appointments, doctor visits, medications, medical tasks, medical prescriptions in pdf format, specific to these patients.</p>\
<p>Specifically, the doctor can continuously, permanently visualize the health progress of each of his patients by assigning certain tasks (medical tasks, such as: taking certain pills, medications - medical syrups, referrals to certain medical offices, hospitals and more) and also visualize the health development by fulfilling these requirements.</p>\
<p>Furthermore, the doctor will have the possibility to visualize a statistic, namely a percentage related to the health of his patients, in order to conclude which of his patients are healthier or less healthy. He will be able to see this statistic broken down by age categories: children under 14, between 14 and 25, between 25 and 40, between 40 and 60, and over 60 - those with a percentage over 50% are considered healthier, the others are more likely to be sicker.</p>\
<p>The application can be addressed in particular to family doctors, so that the latter can be close to their patients, by constantly monitoring the fulfillment of the tasks assigned to them (as mentioned in the previous chapter, tasks related to: pills, prescriptions, referrals to specialized practices, etc.) and the progress, the achieved statuses, carried out so far.</p>\
<h2>MACHINE LEARNING</h2>\
<p>The doctor, with the help of the <strong>AI</strong>, will have the possibility to visualize a statistic, more precisely a percentage related to the health of his patients, in order to conclude which of his patients are healthier or less healthy. He will be able to see this statistic broken down by age categories: children under 14, between 14 and 25, between 25 and 40, between 40 and 60, and over 60 - those with a percentage over 50% are considered healthier, the others are more likely to be sicker.</p>\
<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>\
<p>The app can be accesed by 3 types of users: doctor, pacient and a child pacient -&nbsp; and also, each one has his specifical dashboard.</p>\
<p>The password for patients will be composed of their specific health card PIN or otherwise, if they don't have a card, the last 6 digits of their CNP - the app is meant to access the health card database to extract medical data related to diseases, allergies, etc. and then logging on to the platform is a search of the patient in that database.</p>",
